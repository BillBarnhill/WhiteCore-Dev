~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mar 31 / Apr 1st - Greythane
* SceneManager - additional commands
	- "show objects" - Display a list of objects in the currently selected scene
	- "resize object" - Change the scale of a named object 
	- "rotate region" - Rotates ( 2D, x,y only) all region objects around a center point (default center of region)
    - "scale region" - Scales all region objects by the specified amount
    - "reposition region" - Move region objects by the specified amounts (x,y,z) (Alternative to 'offset region prims')
    - "clear region" - Clear the region of objects leaving the current terrain
* TerrainChannel
    - Additional helper functions

Mar 28 - Greythane
* LSL-Api /LSL-Types
	- increase float equality difference to "0.0000005" as LSL_Float types are only to six decimal places
	- SetPrimParams - Correct PRIM_POSITION postion update to remove incorrect additional offset 
	   (originally reported by Eamon Mayo who also supplied a correction (Aurora))
	 
Mar 26 - Greythane
* LocalGridConnector
  - if no valid data source is available, dont register the local service 
  	( causes null references if called from the sim console when in grid mode )
* SceneManager - Show region <name> command
  - correct call to get region list so that is operates correctly in both standalone and grid mode
  - Update formatting of displayed 'show users' command

* CommandConsole
  - Add 'cleaninfo' format to provide for nicer console messages if/when needed

* WarpTileRenderer
  - Rebuild with some optimisations and using customised Warp3D library (WhiteCore.Warp3D)
  	(requires new Warp3D.dll in bin folder)


Mar 25 - Greythane
* Scenemanager / FileBasedSimulationData
  - Re-work and correct new region creation as the current mods crash for grid mode operations.
  - add a final yes/no to proceed with the creation of the new region
* EstateInitializer
  - small change to prompt wording when creating a new estate
* Gridservice
  - Correct 'show region <name>' processing when used in grid mode
      

Mar 24 - Greythane
* Dropped Xml2 commands after further investigation, OAR's are a better alternative and it does not
    appear that the XML2 format is in common use with OpenSim anyway
* SceneManager 
    - Re-synced new Region commmads after a stuff up in doing so previously
    - Add port to 'Show regions' command
* FileBasedSimulationData
    - Correct some problems in the 'update region info' command


Mar 24 - Fly-Man
* Correction to server configuration files

Mar 22nd - Greythane
*  Corrected setting of default values when no regions exist at startup

Mar 21st - Greythane
* CommandConsole
  - Add 'missed that..' response for multi word commands
* Update prebuild.xml version # to 0.9
* PathHelpers
  - Add VerifyReadFile to shortcut a heap of file checks (reading config, xml etc)
* SceneManger
  - Correct/update/rework CreateNewRegion when a region name and/or a config file is specified


Mar 20th - Greythane
* CommandConsole
  - Add a warning message if a valid command requires a scene and none is selected
* SceneManager
  - SavePrimsXml2 - revamp command and simplify code
  - SaveXML2 - revamp and simplify code
* PathHelpers
  - Add VerifySaveFile to shortcut a heap of file checks (saving config, xml etc)


Mar 19th - Greythane
* SceneManager
  - Additional options for the 'create region' command
	- Specify a region name as part of the command
	- specify a configuration file, containing the region details, to load
  - New command "save region config <filename>" used to save existing configurations to an xml file
 
   
Mar 18th - Greythane
* SceneManager -  additional XML2 commands
	- load xml2 - load an xlm2 format file
	- save xml2 - save current region as an xml2 file
	- save prims xml2 - save a named prim as an xml2 file
* FileBasedSimulationData - Add some 'smarts' when creating a new region. 
    Scan existing regions and suggest available X/Y location and port rather than use defaults


Mar 17th, 2014 - Greythane
* MaintenanceThread - Remove obsolete suspend/resume operation and replace with EventWaitHandle processing 
    (Ongoing verification necessary to ensure that no other issues arise but only use is in show stats command)
* FileBasedSimulationData - Add Sim name to 'Loading sim..' startup info message
 
Mar 16th, 2014 - Greythane
* Additional check for incorrect position of command line switches in 'load oar' command
* BulletSim files - Rename into WhiteCore name space in preparation for further updates

  - if a region is selected, only updates the map for that region

* ScriptData - Updated 'BROKEN SAVE STATE...' message to something a bit more intuitive
* MaintenanceThread - Updated 'BAD VERSION ID...' message to something a bit more intuitive

	(old format .abackup processing)
	 
Feb 9th 2014
* LSL Functions
	- Cleaned up the old Deprecated, ShoutError and NotImplemented
	- Updated the LSL_Api.cs file with all the remaining functions and set those as NotImplemented for this moment
---------------------------------
Feb 3rd 2014
* Treepopulator 
    - correct HandleTreeConfigure() for invalid commandline option being passed
    - update Configure & Update to correctly handle the 'quit' abort entry
    - Provide an option to start tree growth when reload(ing) copse definitions after restart

* Added console info output if entered command has not been recognised
* Changed a bunch of destructive command prompts to default to 'no' instead of 'yes'
* SceneManager - Add checks for operation when the 'root' scene is selected
   - load OAR - Add info message and prompt to continue.

   - reset, remove, restart (runCommand) - Add info message and prompt to continue
     
* Rework LSL_Types operator ==(Vector3 lhs, Vector3 rhs) and Equals(object o) to return an intelligent equaltiy state
   - Currently set to be equal if like values differ by less than 0.00001 (This may need to be revised)
   - Changed to 0.000000001 as investigation of some assets revealed values down to 8 figures 
   eg. 	<OffsetPosition>
   			<X>0.01147739</X>
			<Y>-0.1792226</Y>
			<Z>0.3589401</Z>
		</OffsetPosition> 
* Rework LSL_Type operator LSLFloat operators Boolean, ==, != as per above

---------------------------------
Dec 24th, 2013
Commented out multiple variables that have been declared but not used (No code changes)
	- multiple files, identified with comment > // 20131224 not used
    - see alos  ## TODO ## as some code needs to be re-checked for functionality
    >> build warnings reduced from 82 to 45  
    	- remaing warnings are mainly private field definitions that are not used.... 
    	mainly in WhiteCoreOpenDynamicsEngine - AODEApi.cs & AODEDynamics.cs  and
    	the Physics.BulletSPlugin code (Opensim)

Dec 23rd, 2013
Merged patched applied to Aurora(Master)

Alicia Raven - Fix Bug #1261. Prevent bots being added to currency table. With bots
having random UUID every time they restart, this soon would get out of
hand with trash data.
	- Whitecore(Aurora)/Modules/Avatar/Currency/Simple.CurrencyConnector.cs
mdickson - Updated Texture Fetching to handle bytes=start- and bytes=-end which the newer viewers will send.
	- WhiteCore(Aurora)/Services/GenericServices/CapsService/CAPModules/AssetCAPS.cs
mdickson - Removed uneeded LINUX conditional around LSLFload operators It causes errors on Mono compiles.
	(Corrected this myself prior to this commit :) )
	- WhiteCore(Aurora)/WhiteCoreDotNetEngine(AuroraDotNetEngine)/APIs/LSL_Types.cs
