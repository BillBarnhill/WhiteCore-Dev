* Treepopulator 
    - correct HandleTreeConfigure() for invalid commandline option being passed
    - update Configure & Update to correctly handle the 'quit' abort entry
    - Provide an option to start tree growth when reload(ing) copse definitions after restart

* Added console info output if entered command has not been recognised
* Changed a bunch of destructive command prompts to default to 'no' instead of 'yes'
* SceneManager - Add checks for operation when the 'root' scene is selected
   - load OAR - Add info message and prompt to continue.
   - save OAR - Require change to a named region
   - reset, remove, restart (runCommand) - Add info message and prompt to continue
     
* Rework LSL_Types operator ==(Vector3 lhs, Vector3 rhs) and Equals(object o) to return an intelligent equaltiy state
   - Currently set to be equal if like values differ by less than 0.00001 (This may need to be revised)
   - Changed to 0.000000001 as investigation of some assets revealed values down to 8 figures 
   eg. 	<OffsetPosition>
   			<X>0.01147739</X>
			<Y>-0.1792226</Y>
			<Z>0.3589401</Z>
		</OffsetPosition> 
* Rework LSL_Type operator LSLFloat operators Boolean, ==, != as per above

Dec 24th, 2013
Commented out multiple variables that have been declared but not used (No code changes)
	- multiple files, identified with comment > // 20131224 not used
    - see alos  ## TODO ## as some code needs to be re-checked for functionality
    >> build warnings reduced from 82 to 45  
    	- remaing warnings are mainly private field definitions that are not used.... 
    	mainly in WhiteCoreOpenDynamicsEngine - AODEApi.cs & AODEDynamics.cs  and
    	the Physics.BulletSPlugin code (Opensim)

Dec 23rd, 2013
Merged patched applied to Aurora(Master)

Alicia Raven - Fix Bug #1261. Prevent bots being added to currency table. With bots
having random UUID every time they restart, this soon would get out of
hand with trash data.
	- Whitecore(Aurora)/Modules/Avatar/Currency/Simple.CurrencyConnector.cs
mdickson - Updated Texture Fetching to handle bytes=start- and bytes=-end which the newer viewers will send.
	- WhiteCore(Aurora)/Services/GenericServices/CapsService/CAPModules/AssetCAPS.cs
mdickson - Removed uneeded LINUX conditional around LSLFload operators It causes errors on Mono compiles.
	(Corrected this myself prior to this commit :) )
	- WhiteCore(Aurora)/WhiteCoreDotNetEngine(AuroraDotNetEngine)/APIs/LSL_Types.cs

greythane updates as shown below have already been applied..


Dec 17th, 2013
Refactored Main Aurora-Sim code to WhiteCore to allow continued development
All development moved to WhiteCore

----------------------------------

## Aurora-Sim-Dev ##
Dec 6th, 2013
* Aurora.Framework.Utilities - utilities.cs
	Update GetServerReleaseNotesURL() and GetAddress() to return the defined hostname as specified in the 
	Aurora.ini ( will return external IP if not defined)


<< TerrainGenerator branch >>
* Aurora.Framework.SceneInfo - TerrainChannel.cs
	Added additional perlinNoise generation code - TerrainPerlin.cs
	Modified CreateDefaultTerrain() to pass the landtype entered during console region creation
	Added additional and overide creation procedures for Flatland, Mainland and Island 
	Added GenerateTerrain() to allow user generation of terrain from a console command
* Aurora.Modules.World.Terrain - TerrainModule.cs  
	Added InterfaceGenerateTerrain() for user access to terrain generation
	Added appropriate console command and help details
* Aurora.Modules.World.Startup - FileBasedSimulationData.cs
	Changed default land type to "Flatland" when creating new regions, to avoid confusion with the new "Mainland"

  Oct 2nd 2013
* Aurora.Modules.Terrain - TerrainModule.cs
	Remove added debug commands 
* Aurora.Framework.Sceneinfo - TerrainChannel.cs
	Correct problem when creating/loading a terrainchannel if the source image is not the same as the region size.	

  Oct 1st, 2013
* Aurora.Modules.Terrain - TerrainModule.cs
	Harden LoadFile and SaveFile procedures to avoid complete crash on an unexpected error

  Sept 30th, 2013
* Aurora.Modules.Terrain - TerrainModule.cs
	Finalise updates to load terrain into the correct scene
* Aurora.Services.SQLServices.GridService - GridService.cs
	Add region size to info details
	Correct region URI details
* Aurora.Framework.Services - IGridservice.cs
	Add RegionURI to return region instance uri	
* Aurora.Region - SceneManager.cs
	Add currently selected region name to console prompt    	 	   

  Sept 27th, 2013
* Aurora.Modules.Terrain - TerrainModule.cs
	Update procedures to load terrain into the correct scene as selected

  Sept 26, 2013
* Aurora.ScriptEngine.AuroraDotNetEngine.APIs - LSL_Types.cs - class LSL_Types
	Add (float) type casting to '==' and 'Equals' overrides
* namespace Aurora.Services.SQLServices.GridService -  private struct NeighborLocation
	Add GetHashCode override to satisfy compiler warning and prevent incorrect a == b or a != b comparisons
* Aurora.Modules.World.Startup.SimulationData.FileLoaders - TarRegionLoader.cs - class TarRegionDataLoader
	Correct console error message header on exception  (trivial but... :) )
	Added additional console info during loading of backup file
* Aurora.Modules.WorldMap - class AuroraWorldMapModule - private void GetMapBlocks()
	Correct if..else.. logic when dealing with the item.mapblocks types
* namespace Aurora.Modules.Caps - public class RenderMaterials - RenderMaterialsPostCap()
    Remove comparison of te.DefaultTexture.MaterialID == null as it should always be assigned at creation (debug only)
* Aurora.Modules.Terrain - TerrainModule.cs
	Add checks for missing commandline parameters so that the sim does not crash!! 
	Modify existing error messages to be a bit more helpful       
* FileBasesSimulationData.cs -  FindRegionInfos()
	Correct to use configured (if any) StoreBackupDirectory rather than assume the current directory "."
